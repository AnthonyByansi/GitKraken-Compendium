# Git Rebase Workflow

The git rebase workflow allows you to streamline your commit history, incorporate changes from other branches, and maintain a clean and linear branch history. In this tutorial, we will explore the git rebase workflow and how to utilize it effectively in GitKraken. :twisted_rightwards_arrows: :pencil2:

## Understanding the Git Rebase Workflow

The git rebase workflow involves incorporating changes from one branch onto another by replaying commits. It allows you to maintain a linear commit history, merge branches cleanly, and keep your repository organized.

## Using GitKraken for Rebasing

GitKraken provides an intuitive interface to perform the git rebase workflow. Follow these steps to utilize GitKraken for rebasing:

1. **Select the target branch**: Open the repository in GitKraken and switch to the branch where you want to apply the changes.

2. **Start the rebase**: Right-click on the commit that represents the branch point, then select "Rebase Branch" from the context menu.

## Performing a Git Rebase

When performing a git rebase, follow these steps:

1. **Choose the source branch**: Select the branch that contains the changes you want to incorporate.

2. **Configure the rebase options**: Specify whether you want to apply all commits, only specific commits, or modify commit messages during the rebase process.

3. **Start the rebase**: Click on the "Start Rebase" button to initiate the rebase process.

## Resolving Conflicts during Rebase

During the rebase process, conflicts may occur when GitKraken tries to apply the changes from the source branch onto the target branch. To resolve conflicts:

1. **Review and resolve conflicts**: GitKraken will highlight the conflicting files. Use the built-in merge tool to resolve conflicts by selecting the desired changes or editing the files manually.

2. **Stage resolved changes**: After resolving conflicts, stage the changes by clicking the checkboxes next to the modified files in GitKraken.

## Completing the Rebase

Once conflicts are resolved, complete the rebase process by:

1. **Finishing the rebase**: Click on the "Finish Rebase" button in GitKraken.

2. **Push the changes**: Push the rebased branch to the remote repository to update the branch history.

## Rebase Best Practices

Follow these best practices when using the git rebase workflow:

- **Rebase frequently**: Regularly incorporate changes from the main branch into your feature branches to keep them up to date.

- **Avoid rebasing public branches**: Only rebase branches that you have not shared with others to avoid confusion and potential conflicts.

- **Communicate with your team**: Inform your team members before performing a rebase to ensure everyone is aware of the changes.

- **Document rebased branches**: Add clear commit messages and descriptions when rebasing to provide clarity and context for future reference.

By following the git rebase workflow and leveraging GitKraken's capabilities, you can maintain a clean and organized branch history, incorporate changes seamlessly, and collaborate effectively with your team.
