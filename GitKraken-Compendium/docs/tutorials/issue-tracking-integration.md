## Introduction to Issue Tracking Integration

Issue tracking systems provide a centralized platform to manage project tasks, track bugs, and organize feature requests. Integrating these systems with GitKraken enables seamless communication between development and project management teams, improves issue visibility, and facilitates efficient collaboration.

## Setting Up Issue Tracking Integration

To set up issue tracking integration in GitKraken, follow these general steps:

1. Choose an issue tracking system: Select a popular issue tracking system such as Jira, GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, or Bitbucket Issues, based on your project's requirements.

2. Generate API credentials: Obtain the necessary API credentials from your issue tracking system. This typically involves creating an API token or OAuth application.

3. Configure integration in GitKraken: Access the GitKraken settings, navigate to the issue tracking section, and provide the required API credentials and project information to establish the integration.

4. Verify the integration: Validate the integration by syncing the issue tracking system with GitKraken and ensuring that the necessary project tasks and issues are visible in the GitKraken interface.

## Managing Issues in GitKraken

Once the issue tracking integration is set up, you can efficiently manage issues directly within GitKraken:

1. View and filter issues: Access the issue tracking panel within GitKraken to view all open issues, filter them based on criteria such as assignees or labels, and get a clear overview of the project's task status.

2. Create new issues: Easily create new issues from within GitKraken, providing relevant details such as a title, description, assignee, labels, and due dates. Assign the issue to a team member responsible for its resolution.

3. Update issue status: Progress updates, such as when an issue is in progress, completed, or requires additional information, can be tracked and updated directly within GitKraken.

4. Link commits to issues: Associate Git commits with specific issues by referencing the issue number or using keywords in the commit message. This linkage provides traceability between code changes and project tasks.

5. Collaborate on issues: Engage in discussions, provide feedback, and ask questions related to specific issues within GitKraken, allowing for efficient collaboration between team members.

## Closing Issues with Git Commit Messages

GitKraken offers a convenient way to close issues automatically using git commit messages:

1. Reference the issue in the commit: Include the issue number or use specific keywords in your commit message, such as "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456".

2. Push the commit to the repository: Once you push the commit to the remote repository, GitKraken will detect the reference to the issue and automatically close it in the issue tracking system.

By integrating issue tracking with GitKraken and leveraging its features, teams can streamline project management, enhance collaboration, and maintain better visibility into project tasks and issue resolutions.
