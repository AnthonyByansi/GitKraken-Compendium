- **Branch**: A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

  - **Create a branch**: To create a new branch, use the command `git branch <branch-name>`. Example: `git branch feature-branch`.

  - **Switch to a branch**: To switch to an existing branch, use the command `git checkout <branch-name>`. Example: `git checkout feature-branch`.

- **Commit**: A commit represents a snapshot of your code at a specific point in time. It is a way to save changes to the repository.

  - **Stage changes**: To stage changes for a commit, use the command `git add <file-name>` or `git add .` to stage all changes.

  - **Commit changes**: To commit changes, use the command `git commit -m "Commit message"`. Example: `git commit -m "Added feature XYZ"`.

  - **Merge branches**: To merge a branch into another branch, use the command `git merge <branch-name>`. Example: `git merge feature-branch`.

- **Pull Request**: A pull request is a mechanism for submitting contributions to a repository. It allows you to propose changes and initiate a discussion before merging them.

- **Remote**: A remote is a repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub or GitLab, which enables collaboration and code sharing.

- **Fetch**: Fetching retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.

  - **Fetch changes**: To fetch changes from a remote repository, use the command `git fetch`. Example: `git fetch origin`.

- **Push**: Pushing sends your local commits to a remote repository, updating its branch with your changes.

  - **Push changes**: To push changes to a remote repository, use the command `git push <remote> <branch-name>`. Example: `git push origin feature-branch`.

- **Pull**: Pulling fetches changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your current branch.

  - **Pull changes**: To pull changes from a remote repository, use the command `git pull <remote> <branch-name>`. Example: `git pull origin main`.
