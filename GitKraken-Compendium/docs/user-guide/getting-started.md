# Getting Started with GitKraken

Welcome to GitKraken! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get started with GitKraken and start collaborating on your projects efficiently.

## Setting Up GitKraken

1. **Authentication**: After launching GitKraken, you will be prompted to authenticate with your Git hosting provider. Select your provider (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab) and follow the authentication flow to grant GitKraken access to your repositories.

2. **Repository Cloning**: To work on an existing repository, click on the "Clone a Repository" button in the GitKraken interface. Enter the repository URL and specify the local directory where you want to clone it.

3. **Creating a New Repository**: To create a new repository from scratch, click on the "Create a New Repo" button in the GitKraken interface. Specify the repository name, description, and local directory where you want to initialize the repository.

## Understanding the GitKraken Interface

1. **Commit Graph**: The central component of the GitKraken interface is the commit graph, which provides a visual representation of your repository's commit history, branches, and merges. Each commit is represented by a node, and branches are displayed as colored lines.

2. **File Tree**: The file tree panel displays the files and folders within your repository. You can expand or collapse directories and click on individual files to view their content and history.

3. **Panels**: GitKraken offers several panels that provide additional functionality, including the commit details panel, the branch and tag list panel, the pull request panel, and the code review panel. You can show or hide these panels based on your workflow requirements.

## Basic Git Operations in GitKraken

1. **Committing Changes**: To commit changes, select the files you want to include in the commit by clicking on them in the file tree. Enter a commit message and click the "Commit" button. GitKraken will create a new commit in the commit graph.

2. **Creating and Switching Branches**: To create a new branch, right-click on a commit in the graph or click on the branch button in the top toolbar. Enter the branch name and press Enter. To switch between branches, double-click on the branch name in the graph or use the branch selector in the top toolbar.

3. **Merging Branches**: To merge branches, right-click on the branch you want to merge into another branch and select "Merge into Branch." Select the target branch and click "Merge." GitKraken will perform the merge and update the commit graph accordingly.

4. **Resolving Conflicts**: If conflicts occur during a merge or rebase operation, GitKraken will highlight the conflicting files in the file tree. To resolve conflicts, open the file, locate the conflict markers, and make the necessary modifications. After resolving conflicts, mark the file as resolved in GitKraken.

## Collaborating with GitKraken

1. **Pushing and Pulling**: To push your local commits to a remote repository, click the "Push" button in the top toolbar. To pull changes from the remote repository, click the "Pull" button. GitKraken will update the commit graph with the latest changes.

2. **Creating Pull Requests**: If your Git hosting provider supports pull requests, you can create one directly within GitKraken. Right-click on a branch, select "Create Pull Request," and follow the prompts to set up the pull request. You can review and merge pull requests using the pull request panel.

3. **Code Reviews**: GitKraken provides an integrated code review functionality. Open a pull request, review the changes, add comments, and provide feedback. Collaborators can view and respond to code review comments, enabling a seamless review process.

## Advanced GitKraken Features

1. **Search and Filtering**: Utilize the search bar in the top toolbar to search for specific commits, branches, files, or even text within your repository. You can also apply filters to narrow down your search results and focus on specific criteria.

2. **Undo and Redo**: GitKraken offers undo and redo functionality to revert or reapply actions within the interface. Use the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for undo, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z for redo) or access these options from the Edit menu.

3. **Customization**: GitKraken allows you to customize various aspects of the interface, including themes, fonts, and keybindings. Access the preferences menu to explore and adjust the settings to your preferences.
